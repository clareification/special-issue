    <div class="article">
        <p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">The wounds of rejection cut deep, especially when they come by surprise.</span> Because the end of the school year is a time when many McGill students are waiting to hear back from jobs, internships, and graduate schools, it can be comforting to know that many people are facing the same struggles.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">According to </span><a href="http://ideas.ted.com/why-rejection-hurts-so-much-and-what-to-do-about-it/">Guy Winch</a>, author and psychologist, the feeling of rejection is often associated with the feeling of physical pain, as these experiences activate the same areas of our brain. Though this is a time to be optimistic about future plans, denial from jobs, internships, and schools is common and leaves many students feeling discouraged.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span>Starting university is an incredible new beginning, however, determining which university to attend for undergraduate or graduate studies leaves many students grappling with rejection from their first-choice school. </span>Eliza Snodgrass, U0 Arts, dealt with this before deciding to come to McGill for her undergraduate degree. It was particularly difficult because she became very attached to a school to which she was ultimately not accepted.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">&ldquo;I had fantasized about what I would do once I got [to my first-choice school, the University of Southern California (USC)] and had put so much emphasis on how important it was for me to go there,&rdquo; Snodgrass said. &ldquo;I truly felt like I deserved to get in because I worked so hard.</span> I really tried to show them how much I wanted to go there and how much I cared, I mean, I slept in the T-shirt every single night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    Snodgrass explained that the pain of that the reactions of others were more painful than what she was experiencing herself.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">&ldquo;[My friends and family] kept asking me how I was doing and for some reason everyone kind of expected me to be more upset than I was,&rdquo; Snodgrass said. &ldquo;It made sense, but I think people&rsquo;s reactions were almost harder to deal with than the actual rejection.&rdquo;</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">In dealing with the disappointment of not being accepted, it&rsquo;s important to remember the silver lining in every outcome. In Snodgrass&rsquo; case, she is now loving Montreal and has adopted many leadership roles, such as Vice-President (VP) External of McConnell Hall residence council and Student Ambassador at McGill. </span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">Rejections of all kinds are difficult to deal with, but they are always more difficult when they come from a community a person is already involved in that he or she trusts and cares about deeply. This type of rejection is much more personal, as it causes someone to doubt themselves, their abilities, and their circle of friends or colleagues. In the case of Sofia Harrison, a first-year Science student at the University of Toronto, she experienced these feelings after being rejected from a position at her childhood summer camp. </span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">&ldquo;I had known of many people who had not been asked to return as counsellors, but had never imagined myself to be in that position,&rdquo; Harrison said. &ldquo;So after my tenth amazing summer at camp, I was completely bewildered when I received a letter indicating that I was not chosen to follow the only path I had only ever imagined myself taking.&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">Both Harrison and Snodgrass&rsquo; stories demonstrate how much harder rejection can feel when one is not expecting it. For Harrison, the aspect of jealousy towards those of her friends who got the opportunity she wished to have made dealing with it the hardest. </span>
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;One of the hardest parts of the day I got rejected was the buildup,&rdquo; Harrison said. &ldquo;All day I had been getting texts and snapchats from my friends getting in and telling me to rush home to open up my letter. We were all sure I would get in. Once I got home and opened the letter only to see I had been rejected, I felt like a failure, and I felt like I would lose all my friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    Although Harrison&rsquo;s experience was jarring and difficult to overcome, it forced her to find her own new beginning. She has spent her past two summers working at an art camp and now can&rsquo;t wait to return for her third.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-320adc88-3658-e1e3-2958-40cad0e94fcc">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s important to maintain a good outlook and know that everything happens for a reason,&rdquo; Harrison said. &ldquo;[....] I can&rsquo;t let the fact that I didn&rsquo;t get a position working there ruin a whole lifetime of memories for me.&rdquo; </span>
</p>

<p>
    Although rejection can feel heartbreaking, it is a way to break free from what is expected and open ourselves up to new beginnings. Maybe not getting what we&rsquo;ve planned is meant to remind us that the world is so much more than just one single path. Rejection is a way to gain a new perspective, to reflect on ways to improve, and to eventually grow thicker skin. In this sense, it&rsquo;s important to remember that people&rsquo;s defeats do not define who they are as a person, but help them evolve.

    <div class="leaf"><p><i class="fa fa-leaf" aria-hidden="true"></i> Viewpoint: How I Transferred to McGill</p>
    <div class="article"><p>
    Transferring to a new university is not a decision to make on a whim. If you are coming from outside of Canada, as I was, it can be an even bigger challenge, but I am proof that transferring is feasible, and that it can be the best decision of your life.
</p>

<p>
    I applied to McGill on Dec. 1, 2015, only two months after I started studying at the University of Surrey. Surrey was my safety school, as I hadn&rsquo;t been accepted to any of my top choices in the UK. It&rsquo;s a smaller university of 15,000 students, located about 30 minutes southwest of London. Overall, Surrey was a great university, but from my first day there were several factors that made me question my choice to spend the next four years of my life there.
</p>

<p>
    The University of Surrey states that it guarantees on-campus accommodation to all first year students; however, I wasn&rsquo;t given this opportunity because I had applied to Surrey at the last minute, and all accommodation was full by then. I ended up living in a hotel for the first month of university, which caused me to miss out on a lot of opportunities to meet people and settle into this next stage of my life. I joined a few societies and the volleyball team, but felt like neither the students nor the university took either of them very seriously. My courses were interesting, but weren&rsquo;t very challenging, so I found myself wasting my time more and more as the year went on.
</p>

<p>
    <img alt="(studentcrowd.com)" class="size-full wp-image-52339" height="372" src="http://www.mcgilltribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-University-of-Surrey-011.jpg" width="620" /> 
</p>

<p>
    &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
    After two months of feeling like I was on autopilot, I realized how unhappy I was, and decided I needed a new start. I reapplied to some universities in the UK, and&mdash;on a whim&mdash;branched out to McGill as well.
</p>

<p>
    I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that my transfer to McGill was easy once I&rsquo;d applied. McGill makes it <a href="http://ask.mcgill.ca/?requestType=NormalRequest&amp;source=4&amp;id=615&amp;sessionId=15e01764-1633-11e7-9ec1-01aaee594ab1&amp;question=How+do+I+apply+as+a+transfer+student">painfully obvious</a> that transfer students are only admitted if there is space left in each faculty, and even then only if you show extremely high academic standards. When transferring, most places ask for both your high school and university grades, so maintaining a good GPA is vital to be able to be accepted elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
    Another problem I faced was the timing of my application. My final exams at Surrey were in June, but by mid-May I still hadn&rsquo;t heard back from McGill and needed to know whether to withdraw from Surrey or register for next year&rsquo;s courses. At that point, I called Service Point, academic advisors, and any other relevant numbers I could get hold of almost every day. My persistence eventually paid off, and I believe it helped me stand out among other potential transfer students.
</p>

<p>
    My parents were extremely supportive throughout the process. When I told them about my negative experience at Surrey, they were sympathetic, but wouldn&rsquo;t let me drop out for the rest of the year and apply somewhere else, which was my initial plan. Instead, they suggested I apply to transfer and use my time at Surrey to boost my transfer application. Dropping out without a good reason isn&rsquo;t reflected well in university applications, whether you are a transfer student or not.
</p>

<p>
    Motivations for transferring vary case-to-case. Some students may thrive in a quieter environment with fewer people and less academic stress. Others may feel that they aren&rsquo;t being challenged enough and are frequently bored. Social settings are also worth considering: How easy has it been to make friends or feel comfortable at your current school? The best thing to do is pinpoint why you are unhappy where you are currently, and decide whether uprooting your life to start again will be worth it. It is a huge decision to make, and you have to be confident that you have more to lose by staying at your current university than by moving to someplace new.
</p>

<p>
    I&rsquo;m much happier at McGill than I was at Surrey. I prefer the busy city life to the quiet British countryside, my courses are more demanding, and I am never bored with the wide variety of extracurricular activities available on campus.
</p>

<p>
    If I had to give one piece of advice to students looking to transfer&mdash;either to or from McGill&mdash;it would be to follow your instincts. I knew that deciding to transfer would be the biggest decision of my life up to that point; there were plenty of obstacles in the way, such as application timing and moving to a new continent, that could have easily stopped me. Despite everything, I persevered. In the end, you are the only person who truly understands the situation you are in. If you are unhappy, you owe it to yourself to change your life.

    <p>
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-ca652537-3621-1ee0-1510-ea4d020cd9d7">As the end of the year approaches, many McGill students will venture out of the world of undergraduate studies. Yet even after convocation, many choose to return to university, this time for graduate school. While going to grad school can be a fun and rewarding experience, social pressure to earn post-graduate degrees and the burden of adulthood leave many students feeling apprehensive about this decision. </span>

    <span id="docs-internal-guid-ca652537-3621-1ee0-1510-ea4d020cd9d7">One such voyager into the land of graduate studies is </span><a href="http://www.mcgilltribune.com/student-living/student-of-the-week-claire-motyer-987234/">Claire Motyer</a>, U3 Music. She has recently been accepted to a Master&rsquo;s program in Performance Science across the pond at the Royal College of Music in London, England. While this is an exciting new prospect, Motyer worries if she can both financially afford and emotionally handle more schooling.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-ca652537-3621-1ee0-1510-ea4d020cd9d7">&ldquo;[The fact that I have] already been in school for four years and doing another degree right away is what is holding me back a bit,&rdquo; Motyer said. &ldquo;It can be draining for me not to take some time off. I&rsquo;m not worried about the program I would be in, I think the program I chose is a good fit for me and I&rsquo;m excited about that. It&rsquo;s more aspects like living in London, overseas and far away, and the financial [aspects].&rdquo;</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-ca652537-3621-1ee0-1510-ea4d020cd9d7">Melanie Greenwald, U3 Arts and Science, is also ready to graduate this semester and head into more schooling. Though her post-grad arrangements are not quite set in stone, she plans to return to her hometown on Long Island and study at a graduate school near her parents&rsquo; home to save money. For Greenwald, the deflating value of an undergraduate degree is pushing her to attend grad school; however, she worries that finishing a Master&rsquo;s degree will still not be enough to help her find stable employment.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-ca652537-3621-1ee0-1510-ea4d020cd9d7">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about not finding a job with just a bachelor&rsquo;s degree,&rdquo; Greenwald said. &ldquo;Or even with a Master&rsquo;s degree, which is what I&rsquo;m going for. It&rsquo;s asking yourself, &lsquo;How am I going to find a job?&rsquo; [....] I feel that in the 60s, [since] everyone got a high school degree, [people were] like, &lsquo;Now we have to go to college [to compete&hellip;.]&rsquo; It&rsquo;s really bad for people who can&rsquo;t afford that [because] university is expensive.&rdquo;</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-ca652537-3621-1ee0-1510-ea4d020cd9d7">There&rsquo;s a lot to worry about when getting a Master&rsquo;s degree in modern society. On top of the fatigue of completing more schooling comes the fact that in North America a bachelor&rsquo;s degree is perceived similarly to how high school diplomas were once viewed&mdash;a basic necessity. According to a 2014 article in the </span><em><a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/critics-complain-of-qualification-inflation-as-more-canadians-hold-university-degrees-and-low-paying-jobs">National Post</a></em>, 51 per cent of Canadian adults have at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, but many post-secondary graduates earn less than the national median. This is because the saturation of degree-holders have forced many employers to increase their qualifications. Low-paying jobs that used to only require a high school diploma now require a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or more. Yet, according to the same article, a Master&rsquo;s degree earned immediately after university can make job applicants seem overqualified, despite having no job experience. This leads to many Master&rsquo;s graduates who are either unemployed or underemployed, making it difficult to pay off even the $<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/student-debt-biggest-stress-bmo-poll-finds-1.1219420">27,000 average debt</a> owed by bachelor&rsquo;s graduates. These realities can cause a lot of apprehension for those pursuing even higher education.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-ca652537-3621-1ee0-1510-ea4d020cd9d7">Despite the many factors that can make one hesitant about attending grad school, the </span><em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/04/28/whats-a-degree-worth-depends-on-what-you-study-and-where/?utm_term=.e5e77d982652">Washington Post</a></em>&nbsp;found that a Master&rsquo;s graduate who acquires a job earns more than a bachelor&rsquo;s graduate on average in the U.S. There&rsquo;s also the fact that for some, going into a field one is passionate about gives excitement and hope about what lies beyond the bounds of Strathcona or Burnside.

    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">In February 2017, the 24-hour Second Cup on rue Milton and Avenue du Parc boarded its walls and announced its permanent closure. For 12 years, it served as more than just a coffee shop. With a high percentage of McGill students living in the Milton-Parc community, the cafe was a cozy study space during exam season, wheree students flooded tables with notes and laptops during late hours. </span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">McGill students were shocked by the closing of Second Cup, with many voicing concerns on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/5rctqk/second_cup_on_parcmilton_closed/">social media</a>. Their primary worry was about losing a late night study space, as the Second Cup was one of the few coffee shops open for 24 hours.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">&ldquo;Wow that was an institution,&rdquo; commented Reddit user holistic_water_bottl. &ldquo;Where am I gonna go now when I need to finish a term paper the night before[?]&rdquo;</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">According to Jack Ahmed, former owner of the Second Cup, the main reason that the store closed down was due to issues with licensing.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">&ldquo;There were disagreements [with corporate] that didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with this location,&rdquo; Ahmed said. &ldquo;I used to own several Second Cups. [Basically], they gave me a high bill for renovations, which was not agreed upon [....] So, I said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do this,&rsquo; [....] One by one, my [Second Cups] came up for renewal, and they didn&rsquo;t renew me. [The Milton-Parc one] was the last Second Cup [left], and they didn&rsquo;t renew me.&rdquo;</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">In the end, however, Ahmed is much happier. He believes he now has the freedom to pursue a business model that aligns with his interests. Shortly after hearing the news from corporate, he decided to open a new store in the place of the old Second Cup, a self-described &lsquo;urban cafeteria&rsquo; named Milton B. </span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in business for the last 30 years,&rdquo; Ahmed said. &ldquo;Now, I can go ahead and do what I&rsquo;ve always been dreaming about, creating my own brand.&rdquo;</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">Since Ahmed has been running the Second Cup on Milton for the last 12 years, he cites his familiarity with the Milton-Parc community in helping him develop his idea for the 24 hour caf&eacute;. For Ahmed, his interests in ecology and sustainability are shaping Milton B&rsquo;s business model and brand.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to cater to the community [and also express my love for the environment],&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What better way to represent the [neighbourhood] than the actual name? [.&hellip;] The &lsquo;B&rsquo; in Milton B stands for the bumble bee, [which are] incredibly important [in terms of the environment].&rdquo;</span>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">Basing his model on sustainability practices, Ahmed plans to buy local food. Rather than buying milk from Natrel or Quebon, both of which are large conglomerates, Ahmed says he intends to purchase milk from small dairy farms in the Eastern Townships. Additionally, Ahmed now has the opportunity to expand his menu options and give customers a space to grab a coffee or study while providing fresh, locally sourced food. </span>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">&ldquo;The food from Second Cup was coming in packaged from outside,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We are going to prepare everything on hand, [although] not from scratch.

</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-9b8b8dd4-367f-a3f3-5d08-2f1a19f68962">Though Ahmed admits that he would have kept the Second Cup had the corporation renewed his franchising license, he is still incredibly happy with the work he has done on Milton B. </span>

    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">McGill alumnus Farah Na&rsquo;el Musharbash has created a new method to tie surgical knots that only requires the use of one hand, which can be greatly advantageous to a surgeon. After attending McGill University from 2012 to 2015, Musharbash began medical school at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. He worked closely with the Dean of Medical Education Dr. Michael Awad in developing this technique.</span>

    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">An article and a video of the new method was published&nbsp;</span><a href="http://publishing.rcseng.ac.uk/journal/video?doi=10.1308%2Fvideo.2016.2.2&amp;videoTaxonomy=TECH">online</a> and in the medical journal, <em>The Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England</em>.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new one-handed method for tying surgical knots, where one hand is completely free, except at the end to help tighten the throw,&rdquo; Musharbash explained.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">The majority of suture ties require the use of two hands, and one-handed surgical knots can offer a higher degree of flexibility for a surgeon. This technique allows the other hand to perform a task away from the surgical site, such as maintaining pressure on an organ, which is especially useful in situations when a surgeon may not have an assistant.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">While there were one-handed knot variations that existed prior to Musharbash&rsquo;s method, he found that in practice they actually required both hands. This prompted him to look closely into different knot tying techniques and it took a couple of months before his method was created and finalized.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">Although the knot is actually quite straightforward, Musharbash believes that its simplicity is what makes it special and innovative.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">&ldquo;As students, sometimes we don&rsquo;t have the resources for a big lab,&rdquo; Musharbash said. &ldquo;[But] you have these simple ideas, and [most] of them are not going to end up giving you anything, but if you follow through [on] enough of them, you&rsquo;ll come up with one or two things that are new.&rdquo;</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">As a physiology major at McGill, Musharbash was involved extensively in research. He worked in a biomedical engineering lab with Professor David Juncker and in mathematical research with Faculty Lecturer Sidney Trudeau.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">&ldquo;Getting involved in research gave me the right building blocks and way of thinking [&hellip;] to succeed in med school,&rdquo; Musharbash said.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">While Musharbash believes that it was his research experience at McGill that helped adequately prepare him to face the challenges in medical school, taking leadership roles also helped him develop essential skills in communication, organizing, and turning his ideas into reality. Musharbash is a co-founder of the non-profit organization Heart4Heart at McGill, which aims to provide heart surgeries for children in developing countries.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about how well you do in the books, but rather, how well you communicate, how well you&rsquo;re organized, and if you can make things happen,&rdquo; Musharbash said.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">As for advice for prospective medical students in undergraduate programs, Musharbash recommends having a realistic balance between academics and extracurriculars, as students often try to do everything at once.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-55171793-363c-d2fa-0d0f-e895f0ad377b">&ldquo;Never lose sight of your priorities,&rdquo; Musharbash said. &ldquo;[&hellip;.] And the number one priority [should be] your studies. Have that taken care of before you delve into lots of other things.&rdquo;</span>

    <div class="article">
        <p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">Desperately looking for new ways to cram for upcoming exams? Researchers at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) of McGill University have discovered a way to improve sound memory performance in the brain using magnetic pulses.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">The researchers of the </span><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(17)30198-8">study</a>, published on March 23 in <em>Neuron</em>, asked study participants to perform auditory memory tasks while their brain activity was monitored. Participants listened to pairs of short melodies, which were either the same or had slight pitch changes, and had to identify a change in the pattern.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">It was previously known that a network of neurons in a region of the brain called the parietal stream played a role in auditory memory. However, prior to this study, the role of theta waves in this brain region had not been understood.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">By using two types of brain scanners called magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the MNI researchers were able to detect pulses of theta waves in the parietal stream when the study participants performed auditory tasks.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">&ldquo;We identified that in this very region there was a certain rhythm of theta waves that was strong when the task required the involvement of working memory,&rdquo; Dr. Sylvain Baillet, a co-senior author of the study and Professor in the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Biomedical Engineering, explained.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">To further explore the relationship between theta waves and auditory memory, the study proceeded to expose the theta waves to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while performing the same set of tasks.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">The researchers predicted that TMS would stimulate and enhance the theta waves in the parietal stream, which in turn would improve working memory.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">Before the stimulation began, the researchers programmed the TMS exposure to correspond to the rhythm of the theta oscillations. While being induced with TMS, the participants performed the same memory tasks, but this time with increased improvement.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">Interestingly, the theta activity in the brain predicted the participants&rsquo; performance, according to Philippe Albouy, the study&rsquo;s lead author.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">&ldquo;This means that the more theta waves the brain is generating, the better the participants are at their tasks,&rdquo; Albouy said.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">It was also crucial that the TMS pulses were in sync with the theta oscillations.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">&ldquo;The benefits in terms of performance [were] observed mainly for the rhythmic stimulation only,&rdquo; Albouy clarified. &ldquo;This makes a link between ongoing theta oscillations and [the potential] to modify the rhythm of those oscillations to boost participants&rsquo; performance on a given task.&rdquo;</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">To verify their theory, the researchers repeated the experiment, but this time with non-rhythmic magnetic pulses. This did not result in any improvement in memory, highlighting the fact that the rhythmic magnetic pulses were key.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">Interestingly enough, the TMS machine itself produces a certain sound when activated. This led some researchers to believe that it may be possible that the sound itself improved memory; however, this was quickly disproved.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">The implications of this study may lead to more research on the benefits of TMS on not only auditory memory performance, but vision, perception, and learning, as well. Additionally, it may even have clinical applications, such as aiding Alzheimer&rsquo;s&mdash;a disease that damages neurons and memory in the brain.</span>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <span id="docs-internal-guid-25455de2-3649-67de-bc9c-0d233ddcb717">However, Albouy and Baillet temper speculations of future TMS treatments and insist further research must be done. This study only proved the effects of TMS on short-term auditory memory. The next step for the researchers is to test the long-term effects of stimulation to determine if plasticity in the brain tissue can be altered to improve memory in the long run.</span>

    <div class="leaf"><p><i class="fa fa-leaf" aria-hidden="true"></i>From the Viewpoint: Digital Spring at the McCord Museum</p>
    <div class="article"><p>
    I&rsquo;ve only just walked into &ldquo;After Hours Fashion Tech,&rdquo; an exposition on fashion technology at the McCord Museum, when an usher slaps a futuristic white watch on my wrist and a bartender thrusts an almond-lavender gin cocktail into my hand. I&rsquo;m equipped, buzzed, and ready to maneuver this dense crowd mingling underneath similarly mobile spinning geometric neon lights while DJs pump steady bass heartbeats into the cavernous showspace. Some artist in their underwear is twisting into yoga poses in front of a mirror under muted red lamps.&nbsp; This is the future of fashion, bitches.
</p>

<p>
    The McCord Museum of Social History presented &ldquo;After Hours Fashion Tech&rdquo; last Thursday night. The exposition was a one-night-only technological extravaganza highlighting the beginning of the &ldquo;Printemps Num&eacute;rique&rdquo; (Montreal Digital Spring), Montreal&rsquo;s 2017 theme for the city&rsquo;s annual slew of summer festivals. Scanning the showspace, I notice that I can get holographically fitted for a bra or, for men, a full suit, which seems slightly incomparable, but whatever. A knee-high shelf in the centre of the room displays half a dozen impossibly high heels designed to look like surf-caught seashells and sparkling cliffs. Some have feminist mantras etched into the heels&rsquo; wedges. I immediately wish I had worn heels of my own so that I could easily see over the crowd, to where people are getting fancy mini-burgers.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
    The ultra-modern aspects of the exhibition stand in sharp contrast to the newest temporary exhibition, the Expo 67 (running until October 2017)&mdash;a collection of hostess dresses and other colourful outfits hailing from the year 1967. It&rsquo;s somewhat unclear how much the interactive elements of tonight are meant to work with the Expo display, but patrons tired of the loud DJ hide deep in the maze of pastel suits, swirling their cocktails. While the exhibit is itself visually lush, to my chagrin, nothing about it is interactive besides a spacesuit-clad mannequin that flushes with LEDs when someone walks in front of a hidden camera in the lapel. I ask for a demonstration, but the museum employee informs me that it&rsquo;s broken at the moment; remarkably poor timing, considering it&rsquo;s not a permanent part of the Expo.
</p>

<p>
    Some woman in a virtual reality (VR) headset is stumbling around a cleared semi-circle, using her arms to paint a 3-D dress. I try the headset after her, marvelling at the level of detail in my vaguely dress-like creation. Two minutes later, however, I have to step back to make space for the next Picasso fashionista. Again, I wish that this were a permanent part of the Expo 67 collection, since this Cinderella-esque single night of stylistic innovation would serve a as a greater inspiration for the masses if it could stay.
</p>

<p>
    It seems the primary purpose of this event is networking, given the clusters of tightly packed people clinking glasses and wearing glowing watches, but the friend who accompanied me tells me the usher accidentally registered my synchronized watch under another person named Virginia. I will take time now to apologize to that Virginia for using my watch&rsquo;s insta-contact-swapping powers to swiftly maneuver an awkward dude in a suit trying to flirt with me. I cut him off&shy;&mdash;one press of the watch&rsquo;s single button, and both of our watches light up in apparent synchronization, allowing me to politely leave the conversation. What an unexpectedly awesome side benefit. Please ignore that automatic email from a certain clingy &ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; Virginia.
</p>

<p>
    Ultimately, it&rsquo;s unfortunate that this exposition will not last beyond tonight, as it would be an excellent addition to Expo 67 and no doubt the VR experience would draw visitors. But if this display of technological innovation in fashion is a mere example of what to expect for the festival scene this summer, then the coming months are bound to be exciting and explosively colourful.

    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Team of the Year: Redmen Baseball</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Redmen Baseball was dominant from start to finish this season, posting a 15-1 regular season record and cruising through the postseason to clinch the team&rsquo;s third-straight CCBA national championship. In the first round of the CCBA playoffs, the Redmen conquered the Montreal Carabins to advance, claiming the first and third games of the best-of-three series. In round two, they swept the Concordia Stingers to win the CCBA North conference. Then, they broke out at the national championship, scoring 37 runs while allowing just 11 in the five-game tournament.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the final game, starting pitcher Simon Brisebois was lights-out for the Montreal Carabins, but, tied 2-2 with two outs in the bottom of the seventh, first-year catcher Christopher Stanford took a 1-0 fastball over the left-centre field wall to walk-off with the championship. Head Coach Jason Starr deserves a lot of credit for the squad&rsquo;s success and for never letting them rest on their laurels throughout the year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Male Rookie of the Year: Andrew Seinet-Spaulding (Redmen Football)</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This 300-pound monster established himself as not only the best rookie, but the best defensive tackle in the RSEQ. Freshmen Andre Seinet-Spaulding&rsquo;s penchant for pushing the pile rewarded him with 29 total tackles and 3.5 sacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Seinet-Spaulding&rsquo;s space-eating presence netted him the RSEQ Defensive Rookie of the Year award. At the McGill Football Awards Gala on March 25, he was given the Students&rsquo; Society Trophy for McGill Team MVP, the Friends of McGill Football Trophy for Best Defensive Player, and the Charlie Baillie Trophy for most outstanding team player. He is only the third freshmen in McGill history to be awarded the Students&rsquo; Society Trophy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Seinet-Spaulding&rsquo;s continued dominance on the field bodes well for a McGill team that finished the season 4-4&mdash;Redmen football&rsquo;s best record since 2006. Head Coach Ronald Hilaire has the team moving in the right direction and having a game-breaking young talent like Seinet-Spaulding makes his job that much simpler.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[caption id="attachment_52257" align="aligncenter" width="429"]<img alt="(mcgillathletics.ca)" class="size-full wp-image-52257" height="600" src="http://www.mcgilltribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SpencerBromley.jpg" width="429" /> (mcgillathletics.ca)[/caption]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Redmen Athlete of the Year: Spencer Bromley (Redmen Lacrosse)</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Redmen lacrosse attacker Spencer Bromley continued his streak of excellence this season.&nbsp; He led the CUFLA East Division in goals scored and was third in overall points. His efforts helped secure first place for McGill going into nationals.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The senior captain was announced as a CUFLA All-Canadian, along with teammates midfielder Emile Sassone-Lawless and defender Bradley Hofmann. Bromley is no stranger to superhuman feats, scoring six goals in a game on two separate occasions. The first occurred on Oct. 16 during a 15-8 smackdown of the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees, with the second coming the following week against the Queen&rsquo;s Gaels.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a sign of his continued success, Bromley was the first McGill athlete ever drafted by the National Lacrosse League (NLL). He was selected 48th overall in the fifth round by the Saskatchewan Rush&mdash;a fitting end to the university career of the best lacrosse player in McGill history.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[caption id="attachment_52261" align="aligncenter" width="423"]<img alt="(mcgillathletics.com)" class="size-full wp-image-52261" height="600" src="http://www.mcgilltribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DavidDeAveiro.jpg" width="423" /> (mcgillathletics.com)[/caption]</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Coach of the Year: David DeAveiro (Redmen Basketball)</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In his seventh season with the Redmen, Head Coach David DeAveiro led his squad to their fifth consecutive first-place finish in the RSEQ regular season. With a roster full of veteran talent, the squad cruised through the conference playoffs, beating the Laval Rouge et Or before clinching gold with an 82-65 beatdown over the UQ&Agrave;M Citadins.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite losing their starting point guard Kendrick Jolin to an upper-body injury late in the season, the Redmen managed to remain hot, heading into the U Sports National Tournament as the third seed. After a heartbreaking 72-69 loss last year in the first round against the University of Calgary Dinos, McGill was determined to exorcise their first-round demons and advance. Against a strong Manitoba Bison squad, the Redmen jumped ahead early and never looked back, downing the Bison 63-53. Though the squad lost in the second round to the eventual national-champion Carleton Ravens, the team&rsquo;s fourth-place finish ties McGill&rsquo;s best finish in 40 years.</p>
